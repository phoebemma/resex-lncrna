## Abstract

## Introduction

The skeletal muscle is important for physical health and vitality and responds to both use and disuse by hypertrophying and loss of muscle strength and mass respectively @limEvidenceBasedNarrativeReview2022a . It adapts to physical activty or inactivity. It is therefore of necessity that increasing research is focused on exploring and understanding mehanisms through which the skeletal muscle can contribute to improved human health. Progressive resistance exercise training (PRET); a type of exercise where the skeletal muscle is exercised against progressively increased types of resistance @liu2009 such as free weights , is the most potent non-pharmacological method of stimulating muscle hypertrophy and countering the loss in muscle strength and mass @limEvidenceBasedNarrativeReview2022a

Several studies have explored the expression of genes in response to PRET to determine which mRNAs are differentially expressed and thus the mechanisms through which PRET elicits the beneficial effects i t is reputed to have.

. Long non-coding RNAs aee defined as non-coding RNAs of more than 200 nucleotides length. quite little is known about the majority of lncs @desanctis2021 . Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are said to regulate cellular physiology and function @oo2022 , gene expression @statello2021 and are poorly annotated functionally. Diverse research suggest different lncRNAs play divese functional roles @bridges2021 such as in the cell such as cell cycle regulators @kitagawa2013 , differentiation @delás2017 and in metabolism @sirey2019 As regards PRET, we deem it important to explore the deferentially expressed lncRNAs and the protein coding genes coexpressed with them, hoping to contribute to the body of knowledge about lncRNAs and their functions especially as regards PRET .

We hope to identify lncRNAs that are differentially expressed based on exercise conditions, ie between the trained and untrained and between volumes among the trained. This should help us characterise the impact of lncs in PRET conditions. Since the lncs are reported to affect cellular functions of physiological relevance @statello2021, it is perhaps logical to posit that it would be influenced by PRET in humans

Identify protein-coding genes that show the same expression pattern with the DElncS
