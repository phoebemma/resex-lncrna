  abstract = {Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have significant functions in a wide range of important biological processes. Although the number of known human lncRNAs has dramatically increased, they are poorly annotated, posing great challenges for better understanding their functional significance and elucidating their complex functioning molecular mechanisms. Here, we present LncBook (http://bigd.big.ac.cn/lncbook), a curated knowledgebase of human lncRNAs that features a comprehensive collection of human lncRNAs and systematic curation of lncRNAs by multi-omics data integration, functional annotation and disease association. In the present version, LncBook houses a large number of 270 044 lncRNAs and includes 1867 featured lncRNAs with 3762 lncRNA–function associations. It also integrates an abundance of multi-omics data from expression, methylation, genome variation and lncRNA–miRNA interaction. Also, LncBook incorporates 3772 experimentally validated lncRNA-disease associations and further identifies a total of 97 998 lncRNAs that are putatively disease-associated. Collectively, LncBook is dedicated to the integration and curation of human lncRNAs as well as their associated data and thus bears great promise to serve as a valuable knowledgebase for worldwide research communities.}

  abstract = {Intron retention (IR) by alternative splicing is a conserved regulatory mechanism that can affect gene expression and protein function during adult development and  age-onset diseases. However, it remains unclear whether IR undergoes spatial or  temporal changes during different stages of aging or neurodegeneration like  Alzheimer's disease (AD). By profiling the transcriptome of Drosophila head cells  at different ages, we observed a significant increase in IR events for many genes  during aging. Differential IR affects distinct biological functions at different  ages and occurs at several AD-associated genes in older adults. The increased  nucleosome occupancy at the differentially retained introns in young animals  suggests that it may regulate the level of IR during aging. Notably, an increase  in the number of IR events was also observed in healthy older mouse and human  brain tissues, as well as in the cerebellum and frontal cortex from independent  AD cohorts. Genes with differential IR shared many common features, including  shorter intron length, no perturbation in their mRNA level, and enrichment for  biological functions that are associated with mRNA processing and proteostasis.  The differentially retained introns identified in AD frontal cortex have higher  GC content, with many of their mRNA transcripts showing an altered level of  protein expression compared to control samples. Taken together, our results  suggest that an increased IR is an conserved signature that is associated with  aging. By affecting pathways involved in mRNA and protein homeostasis, changes of  IR pattern during aging may regulate the transition from healthy to pathological  state in late-onset sporadic AD.},

  abstract = {Resistance training (RT) may improve metabolic health; however, the extent of its effectiveness is constantly evaluated to assess improvements in the group means,  thus obscuring the heterogeneous individual effects. This study investigated  inter-individual variation in response to RT as reflected in metabolic health  indicators and how age, sex, nutrition, and pre-training phenotypes are  associated with such variabilities. METHODS: Previously collected data of men and  women (39-73~years, 135 trained, 73 non-trained controls) were pooled for  analysis. Measurements were taken twice before training to estimate individual  day-to-day variations and measurement errors (n~=~208). The individual  responsiveness to the 21-week RT in cardiometabolic health indicators (ie,  systolic blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C),  cholesterol and triglycerides) was determined. Body composition was estimated by  bioimpedance and dietary intake according to 4-day food diaries. RESULTS:  Metabolic responses to RT seemed to be highly individual, and both beneficial and  unfavorable changes were observed. Large inter-individual variations in training  response were not explained by a subject's age, sex, body composition, or  nutritional status, with the exception of improvements in HDL-C, which were  associated with simultaneous decreases in body fat in older women. The incidence  of metabolic syndrome diminished following RT. CONCLUSION: This study showed that  RT could improve some specific metabolic health indicators beyond normal  day-to-day variations, especially in blood lipid profile. Further studies are  needed to elucidate genetic and other mechanisms underlining the heterogeneity of  RT responses. This knowledge may be useful in providing individually tailored  exercise prescriptions as part of personalized preventative health care.},

Like the functions of lncRNA transcripts, the mechanisms that underlie these genome-based functions are varied.

Frailty follows from the combination of several impaired physiological  mechanisms affecting multiple organs and systems. And, though frailty and  sarcopenia are related, they are two different conditions. Thus, strategies to  preserve or improve functional status should consider systemic function in  addition to muscle conditioning. Physical activity/exercise is considered one of  the main strategies to counteract frailty-related physical impairment in the  elderly. Exercise reduces age-related oxidative damage and chronic inflammation,  increases autophagy, and improves mitochondrial function, myokine profile,  insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling pathway, and insulin sensitivity.  Exercise interventions target resistance (strength and power), aerobic, balance,  and flexibility work. Each type improves different aspects of physical  functioning, though they could be combined according to need and prescribed as a  multicomponent intervention. Therefore, exercise intervention programs should be  prescribed based on an individual's physical functioning and adapted to the  ensuing response.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of 15 weeks of resistance training on the frequency of moderate to severe hot flushes in postmenopausal women. STUDY  DESIGN: Postmenopausal women with at least 4 moderate or severe hot flushes or  night sweats per day day were randomized to a 15-week resistance training  intervention or unchanged physical activity. Participants did not exercise  regularly at baseline and had not used any therapy for hot flushes two months  prior to study entry. The resistance training was performed three times per week  and the program contained 8 exercises performed with 8-12 repetitions in 2 sets.  Loads were set individually from eight-repetition maximum-strength tests and  increased progressively. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was change in  mean moderate or severe hot flushes per day from baseline to week 15, assessed  with symptom diaries. Secondary outcomes included change in hot flush score and  time spent on physical activity. RESULTS: Between November 19, 2013, and October  26, 2016, 65 women were enrolled; 58 completed the trial and were included in the  analyses. The mean age was 55 and the mean number of moderate or severe hot  flushes per day at baseline was 7.1; there were no baseline differences between  groups. The frequency of hot flushes decreased more in the intervention group  than in the control group (mean difference -2.7, 95\% CI -4.2 to -1.3). The mean  percentage change was -43.6\% (-56.0 to -31.3) in the intervention group and -2.0\%  (-16.4-12.4) in the control group. CONCLUSION: A 15-week resistance-training  program decreased the frequency of moderate and severe hot flushes among  postmenopausal women and could be an effective and safe treatment option to  alleviate vasomotor symptoms.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Molecular regulation related to the health benefits of different exercise modes remains unclear. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as an  RNA class with regulatory functions in health and diseases. Here, we analyzed the  expression of lncRNAs after different exercise training programs and their  possible modes of action related to physical exercise adaptations. METHODS:  Public high-throughput RNA-seq data (skeletal muscle biopsies) were downloaded,  and bioinformatics analysis was performed. We primarily analyzed data reports of  12 weeks of resistance training (RT), high-intensity interval training (HIIT),  and combined (CT) exercise training. In addition, we analyzed data from 8 weeks  of endurance training (ET). Differential expression analysis of lncRNAs was  performed, and an adjusted P-value {$<$} 0.1 and log2 (fold change) ≥0.5 or ≤-0.5  were set as the cutoff values to identify differentially expressed lncRNAs  (DELs). RESULTS: We identified 204 DELs after 12 weeks of HIIT, 43 DELs after RT,  and 15 DELs after CT. Moreover, 52 lncRNAs were differentially expressed after 8  weeks of ET. The lncRNA expression pattern after physical exercise was very  specific, with distinct expression profiles for the different training programs,  where few lncRNAs were common among the exercise types. LncRNAs may regulate  molecular responses to exercise, such as collagen fibril organization,  extracellular matrix organization, myoblast and plasma membrane fusion, skeletal  muscle contraction, synaptic transmission, PI3K and TORC regulation, autophagy,  and angiogenesis. CONCLUSION: For the first time, we show that lncRNAs are  differentially expressed in skeletal muscle after different physical exercise  programs, and these lncRNAs may act in various biological processes related to  physical activity adaptations.},

In this review, we summarize current  knowledge of lncRNA subcellular localization, factors controlling their  localization, emerging themes, including the role of lncRNA isoforms and the  involvement of lncRNAs in phase separation bodies, and the implications of lncRNA  localization on their function and on cellular behavior.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fibromyalgia is characterized by chronic widespread pain that leads to reduced physical function. Exercise training is commonly recommended as a  treatment for management of symptoms. We examined the literature on resistance  training for individuals with fibromyalgia. Resistance training is exercise  performed against a progressive resistance with the intention of improving muscle  strength, muscle endurance, muscle power, or a combination of these. OBJECTIVES:  To evaluate the benefits and harms of resistance exercise training in adults with  fibromyalgia. We compared resistance training versus control and versus other  types of exercise training. SEARCH METHODS: We searched nine electronic databases  (The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PEDro, Dissertation Abstracts,  Current Controlled Trials, World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical  Trials Registry Platform, AMED) and other sources for published full-text  articles. The date of the last search was 5 March 2013. Two review authors  independently screened 1856 citations, 766 abstracts and 156 full-text articles.  We included five studies that met our inclusion criteria. SELECTION CRITERIA:  Selection criteria included: a) randomized clinical trial, b) diagnosis of  fibromyalgia based on published criteria, c) adult sample, d) full-text  publication, and e) inclusion of between-group data comparing resistance training  versus a control or other physical activity intervention. DATA COLLECTION AND  ANALYSIS: Pairs of review authors independently assessed risk of bias and  extracted intervention and outcome data. We resolved disagreements between the  two review authors and questions regarding interpretation of study methods by  discussion within the pairs or when necessary the issue was taken to the full  team of 11 members. We extracted 21 outcomes of which seven were designated as  major outcomes: multidimensional function, self reported physical function, pain,  tenderness, muscle strength, attrition rates, and adverse effects. We evaluated  benefits and harms of the interventions using standardized mean differences (SMD)  or mean differences (MD) or risk ratios or Peto odds ratios and 95\% confidence  intervals (CI). Where two or more studies provided data for an outcome, we  carried out a meta-analysis. MAIN RESULTS: The literature search yielded 1865  citations with five studies meeting the selection criteria. One of the studies  that had three arms contributed data for two comparisons. In the included  studies, there were 219 women participants with fibromyalgia, 95 of whom were  assigned to resistance training programs. Three randomized trials compared 16 to  21 weeks of moderate- to high-intensity resistance training versus a control  group. Two studies compared eight weeks of progressive resistance training  (intensity as tolerated) using free weights or body weight resistance exercise  versus aerobic training (ie, progressive treadmill walking, indoor and outdoor  walking), and one study compared 12 weeks of low-intensity resistance training  using hand weights (1 to 3 lbs (0.45 to 1.36 kg)) and elastic tubing versus  flexibility exercise (static stretches to major muscle groups).Statistically  significant differences (MD; 95\% CI) favoring the resistance training  interventions over control group(s) were found in multidimensional function  (Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) total decreased 16.75 units on a  100-point scale; 95\% CI -23.31 to -10.19), self reported physical function (-6.29  units on a 100-point scale; 95\% CI -10.45 to -2.13), pain (-3.3 cm on a 10-cm  scale; 95\% CI -6.35 to -0.26), tenderness (-1.84 out of 18 tender points; 95\% CI  -2.6 to -1.08), and muscle strength (27.32 kg force on bilateral concentric leg  extension; 95\% CI 18.28 to 36.36).Differences between the resistance training  group(s) and the aerobic training groups were not statistically significant for  multidimensional function (5.48 on a 100-point scale; 95\% CI -0.92 to 11.88),  self reported physical function (-1.48 units on a 100-point scale; 95\% CI -6.69  to 3.74) or tenderness (SMD -0.13; 95\% CI -0.55 to 0.30). There was a  statistically significant reduction in pain (0.99 cm on a 10-cm scale; 95\% CI  0.31 to 1.67) favoring the aerobic groups.Statistically significant differences  were found between a resistance training group and a flexibility group favoring  the resistance training group for multidimensional function (-6.49 FIQ units on a  100-point scale; 95\% CI -12.57 to -0.41) and pain (-0.88 cm on a 10-cm scale; 95\%  CI -1.57 to -0.19), but not for tenderness (-0.46 out of 18 tender points; 95\% CI  -1.56 to 0.64) or strength (4.77 foot pounds torque on concentric knee extension;  95\% CI -2.40 to 11.94). This evidence was classified low quality due to the low  number of studies and risk of bias assessment. There were no statistically  significant differences in attrition rates between the interventions. In general,  adverse effects were poorly recorded, but no serious adverse effects were  reported. Assessment of risk of bias was hampered by poor written descriptions  (eg, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessors). The lack of a priori  protocols and lack of care provider blinding were also identified as methodologic  concerns. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence (rated as low quality) suggested  that moderate- and moderate- to high-intensity resistance training improves  multidimensional function, pain, tenderness, and muscle strength in women with  fibromyalgia. The evidence (rated as low quality) also suggested that eight weeks  of aerobic exercise was superior to moderate-intensity resistance training for  improving pain in women with fibromyalgia. There was low-quality evidence that 12  weeks of low-intensity resistance training was superior to flexibility exercise  training in women with fibromyalgia for improvements in pain and multidimensional  function. There was low-quality evidence that women with fibromyalgia can safely  perform moderate- to high-resistance training.},

EWGSOP included representatives from four participant organisations, i.e. the European Geriatric Medicine Society, the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism, the International Association of Gerontology and Geriatrics—European Region and the International Association of Nutrition and Aging. These organisations endorsed the findings in the final document.The group met and addressed the following questions, using the medical literature to build evidence-based answers: (i) What is sarcopenia? (ii) What parameters define sarcopenia? (iii) What variables reflect these parameters, and what measurement tools and cut-off points can be used? (iv) How does sarcopenia relate to cachexia, frailty and sarcopenic obesity?For the diagnosis of sarcopenia, EWGSOP recommends using the presence of both low muscle mass + low muscle function (strength or performance). EWGSOP variously applies these characteristics to further define conceptual stages as ‘presarcopenia’, ‘sarcopenia’ and ‘severe sarcopenia’. EWGSOP reviewed a wide range of tools that can be used to measure the specific variables of muscle mass, muscle strength and physical performance. Our paper summarises currently available data defining sarcopenia cut-off points by age and gender; suggests an algorithm for sarcopenia case finding in older individuals based on measurements of gait speed, grip strength and muscle mass; and presents a list of suggested primary and secondary outcome domains for research.Once an operational definition of sarcopenia is adopted and included in the mainstream of comprehensive geriatric assessment, the next steps are to define the natural course of sarcopenia and to develop and define effective treatment.}

  abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNA), small noncoding RNA molecules, may regulate protein synthesis, while resistance exercise training (RT) is an efficient strategy for stimulating  muscle protein synthesis in vivo. However, RT increases muscle mass, with a very  wide range of effectiveness in humans. We therefore determined the expression  level of 21 abundant miRNAs to determine whether variation in these miRNAs was  able to explain the variation in RT-induced gains in muscle mass. Vastus  lateralis biopsies were obtained from the top and bottom ∼20\% of responders from  56 young men who undertook a 5 day/wk RT program for 12 wk. Training-induced  muscle mass gain was determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and fiber  size was evaluated by histochemistry. The expression level of each miRNA was  quantified using TaqMan-based quantitative PCR, with the analysis carried out in  a blinded manner. Gene ontology and target gene profiling were used to predict  the potential biological implications. Of the 21 mature miRNAs examined, 17 were  stable during RT in both groups. However, miR-378, miR-29a, miR-26a, and miR-451  were differentially expressed between low and high responders. miR-378, miR-29a,  and miR-26a were downregulated in low responders and unchanged in high  responders, while miR-451 was upregulated only in low responders. Interestingly,  the training-induced change in miR-378 abundance was positively correlated with  muscle mass gains in vivo. Gene ontology analysis of the target gene list of  miR-378, miR-29a, miR-26a, and miR-451, from the weighted cumulative context  ranking methodology, indicated that miRNA changes in the low responders may be  compensatory, reflecting a failure to "activate" growth and remodeling genes. We  report, for the first time, that RT-induced hypertrophy in human skeletal muscle  is associated with selected changes in miRNA abundance. Our analysis indicates  that miRNAs may play a role in the phenotypic change and pronounced intergroup  variation in the RT response.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Skeletal muscle atrophy manifests across numerous diseases; however, the extent of similarities/differences in causal mechanisms between atrophying  conditions in unclear. Ageing and disuse represent two of the most prevalent and  costly atrophic conditions, with resistance exercise training (RET) being the  most effective lifestyle countermeasure. We employed gene-level and network-level  meta-analyses to contrast transcriptomic signatures of disuse and RET, plus young  and older RET to establish a consensus on the molecular features of, and  therapeutic targets against, muscle atrophy in conditions of high socio-economic  relevance. METHODS: Integrated gene-level and network-level meta-analysis was  performed on publicly available microarray data sets generated from young  (18-35~years) m. vastus lateralis muscle subjected to disuse (unilateral limb  immobilization or bed rest) lasting ≥7~days or RET lasting ≥3~weeks, and  resistance-trained older (≥60~years) muscle. RESULTS: Disuse and RET displayed  predominantly separate transcriptional responses, and transcripts altered across  conditions were mostly unidirectional. However, disuse and RET induced directly  inverted expression profiles for mitochondrial function and translation  regulation genes, with COX4I1, ENDOG, GOT2, MRPL12, and NDUFV2, the central hub  components of altered mitochondrial networks, and ZMYND11, a hub gene of altered  translation regulation. A substantial number of genes (n~=~140) up-regulated  post-RET in younger muscle were not similarly up-regulated in older muscle, with  young muscle displaying a more pronounced extracellular matrix (ECM) and  immune/inflammatory gene expression response. Both young and older muscle  exhibited similar RET-induced ubiquitination/RNA processing gene signatures with  associated PWP1, PSMB1, and RAF1 hub genes. CONCLUSIONS: Despite limited opposing  gene profiles, transcriptional signatures of disuse are not simply the converse  of RET. Thus, the mechanisms of unloading cannot be derived from studying muscle  loading alone and provides a molecular basis for understanding why RET fails to  target all transcriptional features of disuse. Loss of RET-induced ECM  mechanotransduction and inflammatory profiles might also contribute to suboptimal  ageing muscle adaptations to RET. Disuse and age-dependent molecular candidates  further establish a framework for understanding and treating disuse/ageing  atrophy.},

Exercise training enabled the skeletal muscle to counteract age-related sarcopenia by inducing a wide range of adaptations, sustained by the expression of protein-coding genes involved in energy handling, proteostasis, cytoskeletal organization, inflammation control, and cellular senescence. Building on the previous study, we examined here the network of non-coding RNAs participating in the orchestration of gene expression and identified differentially expressed micro- and long-non-coding RNAs and some of their possible targets and roles. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analyses of all non-coding RNAs were able to discriminate between sedentary and trained individuals, regardless of the exercise typology. Validated targets of differentially expressed miRNA were grouped by KEGG analysis, which pointed to functional areas involved in cell cycle, cytoskeletal control, longevity, and many signaling pathways, including AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which had been shown to be pivotal in the modulation of the effects of high-intensity, life-long exercise training. The analysis of differentially expressed long-non-coding RNAs identified transcriptional networks, involving lncRNAs, miRNAs and mRNAs, affecting processes in line with the beneficial role of exercise training.},

Twelve healthy sedentary men were studied in 1985-86 (T1)  and nine (initial mean age 65.4 +/- 4.2 yr) were reevaluated in 1997-98 (T2).  Isokinetic muscle strength of the knee and elbow extensors and flexors showed  losses (P {$<$} 0.05) ranging from 20 to 30\% at slow and fast angular velocities.  Computerized tomography (n = 7) showed reductions (P {$<$} 0.05) in the  cross-sectional area (CSA) of the thigh (12.5\%), all thigh muscles (14.7\%),  quadriceps femoris muscle (16.1\%), and flexor muscles (14. 9\%). Analysis of  covariance showed that strength at T1 and changes in CSA were independent  predictors of strength at T2. Muscle biopsies taken from vastus lateralis muscles  (n = 6) showed a reduction in percentage of type I fibers (T1 = 60\% vs. T2 = 42\%)  with no change in mean area in either fiber type. The capillary-to-fiber ratio  was significantly lower at T2 (1.39 vs. 1. 08; P = 0.043). Our observations  suggest that a quantitative loss in muscle CSA is a major contributor to the  decrease in muscle strength seen with advancing age and, together with muscle  strength at T1, accounts for 90\% of the variability in strength at T2.},

  abstract = {Fibromyalgia (FM) is a complex disorder and a clinical challenge to diagnose and treat. Microdialysis is a valuable tool that has been used to investigate the  interstitial proteins and metabolites of muscle in patients with fibromyalgia.  The implantation of the catheter in the muscle causes acute tissue trauma and  nociception. The aim of this study was to investigate acute proteome changes in  the vastus lateralis muscle in women fibromyalgia patients (FM) and healthy  subjects (CON). A further aim was to study if a 15-week resistance exercise  program in FM had any influence on how chronic painful muscle responds to acute  nociception. Twenty-six women patients with FM and twenty-eight CON were included  in this study. A microdialysis catheter (100 kilo Dalton cut off, membrane 30 mm)  was inserted in the vastus lateralis muscle, and samples were collected every 20  min. Subjects rated pain before catheter insertion, directly after, and every 20  min of sample collection. Dialysate samples from time points 0-120 were pooled  and considered trauma samples due to the catheter insertion. The samples were  analyzed with nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (nLC-MS/MS).  Advanced multivariate data analysis was used to investigate protein profile  changes between the groups. Multivariate data analysis showed significant  (CV-ANOVA p = 0.036) discrimination between FM and CON based on changes in 26  proteins. After the 15-week exercise intervention, the expression levels of the  15 proteins involved in muscle contraction, response to stimulus, stress, and  immune system were increased to the same expression levels as in CON. In  conclusion, this study shows that microdialysis, in combination with proteomics,  can provide new insights into the interstitial proteome in the muscle of FM. In  response to acute nociception, exercise may alter the innate reactivity in FM.  Exercise may also modulate peripheral muscle proteins related to muscle  contraction, stress, and immune response in patients with FM.},

  abstract = {Gene expression profiling has identified numerous processes altered in aging, but how these changes arise is largely unknown. Here we combined nascent RNA sequencing and RNA polymerase II chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing to elucidate the underlying mechanisms triggering gene expression changes in wild-type aged mice. We found that in 2-year-old liver, 40\% of elongating RNA polymerases are stalled, lowering productive transcription and skewing transcriptional output in a gene-length-dependent fashion. We demonstrate that this transcriptional stress is caused by endogenous DNA damage and explains the majority of gene expression changes in aging in most mainly postmitotic organs, specifically affecting aging hallmark pathways such as nutrient sensing, autophagy, proteostasis, energy metabolism, immune function and cellular stress resilience. Age-related transcriptional stress is evolutionary conserved from nematodes to humans. Thus, accumulation of stochastic endogenous DNA damage during aging deteriorates basal transcription, which establishes the age-related transcriptome and causes dysfunction of key aging hallmark pathways, disclosing how DNA damage functionally underlies major aspects of normal aging.}

  abstract = {KEY POINTS: For individuals showing suboptimal adaptations to resistance training, manipulation of training volume is a potential measure to facilitate  responses. This remains unexplored. Here, 34 untrained individuals performed  contralateral resistance training with moderate and low volume for 12~weeks.  Moderate volume led to larger increases in muscle cross-sectional area, strength  and type II fibre-type transitions. These changes coincided with greater  activation of signalling pathways controlling muscle growth and greater induction  of ribosome synthesis. Out of 34 participants, thirteen displayed clear benefit  of MOD on muscle hypertrophy and sixteen showed clear benefit of MOD on muscle  strength gains. This coincided with greater total RNA accumulation in the early  phase of the training period, suggesting that ribosomal biogenesis regulates the  dose-response relationship between training volume and muscle hypertrophy. These  results demonstrate that there is a dose-dependent relationship between training  volume and outcomes. On the individual level, benefits of higher training volume  were associated with increased ribosomal biogenesis. ABSTRACT:  Resistance-exercise volume is a determinant of training outcomes. However not all  individuals respond in a dose-dependent fashion. In this study, 34 healthy  individuals (males n~=~16, 23.6 (4.1)~years; females n~=~18, 22.0 (1.3)~years)  performed moderate- (3 sets per exercise, MOD) and low-volume (1 set, LOW)  resistance training in a contralateral fashion for 12~weeks (2-3 sessions~per  week). Muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) and strength were assessed at Weeks 0  and 12, along with biopsy sampling (m. vastus lateralis). Muscle biopsies were  also sampled before and 1~h after the fifth session (Week 2). MOD resulted in  larger increases in muscle CSA (5.2 (3.8)\% versus 3.7 (3.7)\%, P~{$<~$}0.001) and  strength (3.4-7.7\% difference, all P~{$<~$}0.05. This coincided with greater  reductions in type IIX fibres from Week~0 to Week~12 (MOD, -4.6 percentage  points; LOW -3.2 percentage points), greater phosphorylation of S6-kinase~1 (p85  S6K1(Thr412) , 19\%; p70 S6K1(Thr389) , 58\%) and ribosomal protein S6(Ser235/236)  (37\%), greater rested-state total RNA (8.8\%) and greater exercise-induced c-Myc  mRNA expression (25\%; Week~2, all P~{$<~$}0.05). Thirteen and sixteen participants,  respectively, displayed clear benefits in response to MOD on muscle hypertrophy  and strength. Benefits were associated with greater accumulation of total RNA at  Week~2 in the MOD leg, with every 1\% difference increasing the odds of MOD  benefit by 7.0\% (P~=~0.005) and 9.8\% (P~=~0.002). In conclusion, MOD led to  greater functional and biological adaptations than LOW. Associations between  dose-dependent total RNA accumulation and increases in muscle mass and strength  point to ribosome biogenesis as a determinant of dose-dependent training  responses.},

  abstract = {AIM: To describe ribosome biogenesis during resistance training, its relation to training volume and muscle growth. METHODS: A training group (n~=~11) performed  12 sessions (3-4 sessions per week) of unilateral knee extension with constant  and variable volume (6 and 3-9 sets per session respectively) allocated to either  leg. Ribosome abundance and biogenesis markers were assessed from vastus  lateralis biopsies obtained at baseline, 48~hours after sessions 1, 4, 5, 8, 9  and 12, and after eight days of de-training, and from a control group (n~=~8).  Muscle thickness was measured before and after the intervention. RESULTS:  Training led to muscle growth (3.9\% over baseline values, 95\% CrI: [0.2, 7.5] vs.  control) with concomitant increases in total RNA, ribosomal RNA, upstream binding  factor (UBF) and ribosomal protein S6 with no differences between volume  conditions. Total RNA increased rapidly in response to the first four sessions  (8.6\% [5.6, 11.7] per session), followed by a plateau and peak values after  session 8 (49.5\% [34.5, 66.5] above baseline). Total RNA abundance was associated  with UBF protein levels (5.0\% [0.2, 10.2] per unit UBF), and the rate of increase  in total RNA levels predicted hypertrophy (0.3~mm [0.1, 0.4] per \%-point increase  in total RNA per session). After de-training, total RNA decreased (-19.3\% [-29.0,  -8.1]) without muscle mass changes indicating halted biosynthesis of ribosomes.  CONCLUSION: Ribosomes accumulate in the initial phase of resistance training with  abundances sensitive to training cessation and associated with UBF protein  levels. The average accumulation rate predicts muscle training-induced  hypertrophy.},

We assessed pre- and  post-training knee extension, knee flexion and plantar flexion isometric  strength, rectus femoris, semitendinosus and medial gastrocnemius muscle  morphology, as well as functional strength, gross motor function and walking  capacity. Data processing was performed blinded. Linear mixed models were applied  to evaluate the difference in evolution over time between the control and  intervention group (interaction-effect) and within each group (time-effect). The  α-level was set at p = 0.01. Knee flexion strength and unilateral heel raises  showed a significant interaction-effect (p ≤ 0.008), with improvements in the  intervention group (p ≤ 0.001). Moreover, significant time-effects were seen for  knee extension and plantar flexion isometric strength, rectus femoris and medial  gastrocnemius MV, sit-to-stand and lateral step-up in the intervention group (p ≤  0.004). Echo-intensity, muscle lengths and gross motor function showed limited to  no changes. PRT improved strength and MV in the intervention group, whereby  strength parameters significantly or close to significantly differed from the  control group. Although, relative improvements in strength were larger than  improvements in MV, important effects were seen on the maintenance of muscle size  relative to skeletal growth. In conclusion, this study proved the effectiveness  of a home-based, physiotherapy supervised, PRT program to improve isometric and  functional muscle strength in children with SCP without negative effects on  muscle properties or any serious adverse events.

Recent studies have revealed that disruption of LncRNAs levels correlates with several human diseases, including diabetes mellitus (DM), a complex multifactorial metabolic disorder affecting more than 400 million people worldwide. LncRNAs are emerging as pivotal regulators in various biological processes, in the progression of DM and its associated complications, involving pancreatic β-cell disorder, insulin resistance, and epigenetic regulation, etc . Further investigation into the mechanisms of action of LncRNAs in DM will be of great value in the thorough understanding of pathogenesis. However, prior to successful application of LncRNAs, further search for molecular biomarkers and drug targets to provide a new strategy for DM prevention, early diagnosis, and therapy is warranted.}

Understanding the molecular mechanism of lncRNAs underlying senescence could facilitate interpretation and intervention of aging and age-related diseases. In this review, we describe categories of known and novel lncRNAs that have been involved in the progression of senescence. We also identify the lncRNAs implicated in diseases arising from age-driven degeneration or dysfunction in some representative organs and systems (brains, liver, muscle, cardiovascular system, bone pancreatic islets, and immune system). Improved comprehension of lncRNAs in the aging process on all levels, from cell to organismal, may provide new insights into the amelioration of age-related pathologies and prolonged healthspan.},

  abstract = {Purpose  This study aimed to assess the effects of 20 wk resistance exercise training with or without protein supplementation on body composition, muscle mass, muscle strength, physical performance, and aerobic capacity in prostate cancer patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Methods Sixty prostate cancer patients receiving ADT were randomly assigned to perform 20 wk of resistance exercise training with supplementation of 31 g whey protein (EX + PRO, n = 30) or placebo (EX + PLA, n = 30), consumed immediately after exercise and every night before sleep. A separate control group (CON, n = 36) only received usual care. At baseline and after 20 wk, body composition (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry), muscle mass (computed tomography scan), muscle strength (1-repetition maximum strength tests), physical performance (Timed Up and Go Test, 30-Second Chair Stand Test, and Stair Climb Test), aerobic capacity (cardiopulmonary exercise test), and habitual dietary intake (food diary) were assessed. Data were analyzed using a two-factor repeated-measures ANOVA. Results Over time, muscle mass and strength increased in EX + PRO and EX + PLA and decreased in CON. Total fat mass and fat percentage increased in EX + PRO and CON, but not in EX + PLA. Physical performance did not significantly change over time in either group. Aerobic capacity was maintained in EX + PLA, but it decreased in EX + PRO and CON. Habitual protein intake (without supplements) averaged {$>$}1.0 g·kg body weight−1·d−1, with no differences over time or between groups. Conclusions In prostate cancer patients, resistance exercise training counteracts the adverse effects of ADT on body composition, muscle mass, muscle strength, and aerobic capacity, with no additional benefits of protein supplementation.},

  abstract = {Sarcopenia is a generalised skeletal muscle disorder characterised by reduced muscle strength and mass and associated with a range of negative health outcomes.  Currently, resistance exercise (RE) is recommended as the first-line treatment  for counteracting the deleterious consequences of sarcopenia in older adults.  However, whilst there is considerable evidence demonstrating that RE is an  effective intervention for improving muscle strength and function in healthy  older adults, much less is known about its benefits in older people living with  sarcopenia. Furthermore, evidence for its optimal prescription and delivery is  very limited and any potential benefits of RE are unlikely to be realised in the  absence of an appropriate exercise dose. We provide a summary of the underlying  principles of effective RE prescription (specificity, overload and progression)  and discuss the main variables (training frequency, exercise selection, exercise  intensity, exercise volume and rest periods) that can be manipulated when  designing RE programmes. Following this, we propose that an RE programme that  consists of two exercise sessions per week and involves a combination of upper-  and lower-body exercises performed with a relatively high degree of effort for  1-3 sets of 6-12 repetitions is appropriate as a treatment for sarcopenia. The  principles of RE prescription outlined here and the proposed RE programme  presented in this paper provide a useful resource for clinicians and exercise  practitioners treating older adults with sarcopenia and will also be of value to  researchers for standardising approaches to RE interventions in future sarcopenia  studies.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: (1) To determine the effects of a 9-month resistance training intervention on quality of life, sense of coherence, and depressive symptoms in  older adults, and (2) to compare effects between different training frequencies.  METHODS: Men and women aged 65-75 (N\,=\,106) were randomized to four groups  according to training frequency: training groups RT1 (n\,=\,26), RT2 (n\,=\,27), and  RT3 (n\,=\,28) and non-training control group (n\,=\,25). All training groups  attended supervised resistance training twice a week for 3 months. For the  following 6 months, they continued training with different frequencies (1, 2 or 3  times per week). Psychological functioning was measured by quality of life  (WHOQOL-Bref), sense of coherence (Antonovsky's SOC-13), and depressive symptoms  (Beck's Depression Inventory II). Measurements were conducted at baseline and 3  and 9 months after baseline. The effects of the intervention were analyzed using  generalized estimating equations (GEE). RESULTS: After 3 months, there was an  intervention effect on environmental quality of life (group\,×\,time p\,=\,.048).  Between 3 and 9 months, environmental quality of life decreased among RT1  compared to RT2 and RT3 (group\,×\,time p\,=\,.025). Between baseline and 9 months,  environmental quality of life increased in RT2 compared to all other groups  (group\,×\,time p\,=\,.011). Sense of coherence increased in RT2 compared to the  control group and RT3 (group\,×\,time p\,=\,.032). CONCLUSION: Resistance training is  beneficial for environmental quality of life and sense of coherence. Attending  resistance training twice a week seems to be the most advantageous for these  aspects of psychological functioning.},

Therefore, every single gene has the opportunity of producing  multiple splice variants, including long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes that  undergo RNA maturation steps such as conventional and alternative splicing.  Emerging evidence suggests significant roles for these lncRNA splice variants in  many aspects of cell biology. Differential changes in expression of specific  lncRNA splice variants have also been associated with many diseases including  cancer.

We provide exclusive insights on the AS landscape of lncRNAs and  also describe at the molecular level the functional relevance of lncRNA splice  variants, i.e., RNA-based differential functions, production of micropeptides,  and generation of circular RNAs. Finally, we discuss exciting perspectives for  this emerging field and outline the work required to further develop research  endeavors in this field.},

Muscle strength in women with FM is  reduced compared to healthy women. The aim of this study was to examine the  effects of a progressive resistance exercise program on muscle strength, health  status, and current pain intensity in women with FM. METHODS: A total of 130  women with FM (age 22-64 years, symptom duration 0-35 years) were included in  this assessor-blinded randomized controlled multi-center trial examining the  effects of progressive resistance group exercise compared with an active control  group. A person-centred model of exercise was used to support the participants'  self-confidence for management of exercise because of known risks of  activity-induced pain in FM. The intervention was performed twice a week for 15  weeks and was supervised by experienced physiotherapists. Primary outcome measure  was isometric knee-extension force (Steve Strong®), secondary outcome measures  were health status (FIQ total score), current pain intensity (VAS), 6MWT,  isometric elbow-flexion force, hand-grip force, health related quality of life,  pain disability, pain acceptance, fear avoidance beliefs, and patient global  impression of change (PGIC). Outcomes were assessed at baseline and immediately  after the intervention. Long-term follow up comprised the self-reported  questionnaires only and was conducted after 13-18 months. Between-group and  within-group differences were calculated using non-parametric statistics.  RESULTS: Significant improvements were found for isometric knee-extension force  (p = 0.010), health status (p = 0.038), current pain intensity (p = 0.033), 6MWT  (p = 0.003), isometric elbow flexion force (p = 0.02), pain disability (p =  0.005), and pain acceptance (p = 0.043) in the resistance exercise group (n = 56)  when compared to the control group (n = 49). PGIC differed significantly (p =  0.001) in favor of the resistance exercise group at post-treatment examinations.  No significant differences between the resistance exercise group and the active  control group were found regarding change in self-reported questionnaires from  baseline to 13-18 months. CONCLUSIONS: Person-centered progressive resistance  exercise was found to be a feasible mode of exercise for women with FM, improving  muscle strength, health status, and current pain intensity when assessed  immediately after the intervention.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Strong evidence shows that physical inactivity increases the risk of many adverse health conditions, including major non-communicable diseases such as  coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and breast and colon cancers, and  shortens life expectancy. Because much of the world's population is inactive,  this link presents a major public health issue. We aimed to quantify the eff ect  of physical inactivity on these major non-communicable diseases by estimating how  much disease could be averted if inactive people were to become active and to  estimate gain in life expectancy at the population level. METHODS: For our  analysis of burden of disease, we calculated population attributable fractions  (PAFs) associated with physical inactivity using conservative assumptions for  each of the major non-communicable diseases, by country, to estimate how much  disease could be averted if physical inactivity were eliminated. We used  life-table analysis to estimate gains in life expectancy of the population.  FINDINGS: Worldwide, we estimate that physical inactivity causes 6\% (ranging from  3·2\% in southeast Asia to 7·8\% in the eastern Mediterranean region) of the burden  of disease from coronary heart disease, 7\% (3·9-9·6) of type 2 diabetes, 10\%  (5·6-14·1) of breast cancer, and 10\% (5·7-13·8) of colon cancer. Inactivity  causes 9\% (range 5·1-12·5) of premature mortality, or more than 5·3 million of  the 57 million deaths that occurred worldwide in 2008. If inactivity were not  eliminated, but decreased instead by 10\% or 25\%, more than 533 000 and more than  1·3 million deaths, respectively, could be averted every year. We estimated that  elimination of physical inactivity would increase the life expectancy of the  world's population by 0·68 (range 0·41-0·95) years.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To quantify age, sex, sport and training type-specific effects of resistance training on physical performance, and to characterise dose-response  relationships of resistance training parameters that could maximise gains in  physical performance in youth athletes. DESIGN: Systematic review and  meta-analysis of intervention studies. DATA SOURCES: Studies were identified by  systematic literature search in the databases PubMed and Web of Science  (1985-2015). Weighted mean standardised mean differences (SMDwm) were calculated  using random-effects models. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: Only  studies with an active control group were included if these investigated the  effects of resistance training in youth athletes (6-18\>years) and tested at least  one physical performance measure. RESULTS: 43 studies met the inclusion criteria.  Our analyses revealed moderate effects of resistance training on muscle strength  and vertical jump performance (SMDwm 0.8-1.09), and small effects on linear  sprint, agility and sport-specific performance (SMDwm 0.58-0.75). Effects were  moderated by sex and resistance training type. Independently computed  dose-response relationships for resistance training parameters revealed that a  training period of {$>$}23\>weeks, 5 sets/exercise, 6-8 repetitions/set, a training  intensity of 80-89\% of 1 repetition maximum (RM), and 3-4\>min rest between sets  were most effective to improve muscle strength (SMDwm 2.09-3.40).  SUMMARY/CONCLUSIONS: Resistance training is an effective method to enhance muscle  strength and jump performance in youth athletes, moderated by sex and resistance  training type. Dose-response relationships for key training parameters indicate  that youth coaches should primarily implement resistance training programmes with  fewer repetitions and higher intensities to improve physical performance measures  of youth athletes.},

  abstract = {Skeletal muscle plays a critical role in physical function and metabolic health. Muscle is a highly adaptable tissue that responds to resistance exercise (RE;  loading) by hypertrophying, or during muscle disuse, RE mitigates muscle loss.  Resistance exercise training (RET)-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy is a  product of external (e.g., RE programming, diet, some supplements) and internal  variables (e.g., mechanotransduction, ribosomes, gene expression, satellite cells  activity). RE is undeniably the most potent nonpharmacological external variable  to stimulate the activation/suppression of internal variables linked to muscular  hypertrophy or countering disuse-induced muscle loss. Here, we posit that despite  considerable research on the impact of external variables on RET and hypertrophy,  internal variables (i.e., inherent skeletal muscle biology) are dominant in  regulating the extent of hypertrophy in response to external stimuli. Thus,  identifying the key internal skeletal muscle-derived variables that mediate the  translation of external RE variables will be pivotal to determining the most  effective strategies for skeletal muscle hypertrophy in healthy persons. Such  work will aid in enhancing function in clinical populations, slowing functional  decline, and promoting physical mobility. We provide up-to-date, evidence-based  perspectives of the mechanisms regulating RET-induced skeletal muscle  hypertrophy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Muscle weakness in old age is associated with physical function decline. Progressive resistance strength training (PRT) exercises are designed to  increase strength. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of PRT on older people and  identify adverse events. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint  and Muscle Trauma Group Specialized Register (to March 2007), the Cochrane  Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2007, Issue 2),  MEDLINE (1966 to May 01, 2008), EMBASE (1980 to February 06 2007), CINAHL (1982  to July 01 2007) and two other electronic databases. We also searched reference  lists of articles, reviewed conference abstracts and contacted authors. SELECTION  CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials reporting physical outcomes of PRT for  older people were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors  independently selected trials, assessed trial quality and extracted data. Data  were pooled where appropriate. MAIN RESULTS: One hundred and twenty one trials  with 6700 participants were included. In most trials, PRT was performed two to  three times per week and at a high intensity. PRT resulted in a small but  significant improvement in physical ability (33 trials, 2172 participants; SMD  0.14, 95\% CI 0.05 to 0.22). Functional limitation measures also showed  improvements: e.g. there was a modest improvement in gait speed (24 trials, 1179  participants, MD 0.08 m/s, 95\% CI 0.04 to 0.12); and a moderate to large effect  for getting out of a chair (11 trials, 384 participants, SMD -0.94, 95\% CI -1.49  to -0.38). PRT had a large positive effect on muscle strength (73 trials, 3059  participants, SMD 0.84, 95\% CI 0.67 to 1.00). Participants with osteoarthritis  reported a reduction in pain following PRT(6 trials, 503 participants, SMD -0.30,  95\% CI -0.48 to -0.13). There was no evidence from 10 other trials (587  participants) that PRT had an effect on bodily pain. Adverse events were poorly  recorded but adverse events related to musculoskeletal complaints, such as joint  pain and muscle soreness, were reported in many of the studies that prospectively  defined and monitored these events. Serious adverse events were rare, and no  serious events were reported to be directly related to the exercise programme.  AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review provides evidence that PRT is an effective  intervention for improving physical functioning in older people, including  improving strength and the performance of some simple and complex activities.  However, some caution is needed with transferring these exercises for use with  clinical populations because adverse events are not adequately reported.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fibromyalgia (FM) is characterized by chronic and generalized musculoskeletal pain. There is currently no cure for FM, but alternative  treatments are available. Among them, gradual strength training programs (ST)  which on daily activities are a valid option to improve some of the pronounced  symptoms of FM that affect quality of life, such as fatigue, pain, sleep quality,  and physical function. However, there is a need for more information on optimal  training programs to improve anxiety and fatigue symptoms. AIM: To analyze the  effects of a 24-week gradual and progressive ST on sleep quality, fatigue, pain  domains, physical function, and anxiety-state. METHODS: 41 women with FM  participated in the 24 weeks of intervention based on gradual and progressive ST.  Two, 60 min, training sessions per week were con-ducted. Participants were  evaluated before the ST program (week 0), in week 12 and at the end of the ST  program (week 24). The Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire was used to  assess sleep quality and fatigue scales. Anxiety-state was evaluated with the  State Anxiety Inventory, and pain domains by means of the Brief Pain Inventory.  Senior Fitness Test was used for physical function measurements. One-way analysis  of variance (ANOVA) was applied to assess the mean differences between phases,  and Spearman's correlations were used to assess the associations between physical  and psychological symptoms, and physical function. RESULTS: The results  demonstrated that 24 weeks of ST improves physical function, sleep quality and  pain domains (p ≤ 0.05). Higher anxiety and pain interference scores were related  to worsening physical function. CONCLUSIONS: Gradual ST significantly improves  sleep quality, pain, and physical function, but not anxiety and fatigue.},

  abstract = {Adult aging is characterized by a progressive deterioration of biological functions at physiological, cellular and molecular levels, but its damaging effects on the transcriptome are not well characterized. Here, by analyzing splicing patterns in ∼1,000 human subjects sampled across multiple tissues, we found that splicing fidelity declines with age. Most prominently, genuine introns fail to be spliced out, manifesting as a broad surge in intron retention, and this is exacerbated by the increase in diverse spurious exon-exon junctions with age. Both of these effects are prominently detected in the majority of human tissues. Collectively, they result in the progressive deterioration of the active transcriptome, wherein functional mRNAs are increasingly diluted with non-functional splicing isoforms. We discuss the concept of “splicing damage” and formulate methods to quantify it. Using these tools, we show that splicing damage increases both with age and with the incidence of diseases. Altogether, this work uncovers transcriptome damage as a critical molecular indicator of human aging and healthspan.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.}

Only a  minority of known lncRNAs have been functionally characterised; however, a  handful of these lncRNAs have already been linked to ageing-associated processes.  To gain more information on the effects of ageing on lncRNAs, we identified from  GTEx data lncRNAs that show ageing-associated expression patterns (age-lncRNAs)  in 29 human tissues in 20-79-year-old individuals. The age-lncRNAs identified  were highly tissue-specific, but the protein coding genes co-expressed with the  age-lncRNAs and the functional categories associated with the age-lncRNAs showed  significant overlap across tissues. Functions associated with the age-lncRNAs,  including immune system processes and transcription, were similar to what has  previously been reported for protein coding genes with ageing-associated  expression pattern. As the tissue-specific age-lncRNAs were associated with  shared functions across tissues, they may reflect the tissue-specific fine-tuning  of the common ageing-associated processes. The present study can be utilised as a  resource when selecting and prioritising lncRNAs for further functional analyses.},

The term ‘lncRNAs’ encompasses RNA polymerase~I (Pol I), Pol~II and~Pol~III transcribed RNAs, and RNAs from processed introns. The various functions of lncRNAs and their many isoforms and interleaved relationships with other genes make lncRNA classification and annotation difficult. Most lncRNAs evolve more rapidly than protein-coding sequences, are cell type specific and regulate many aspects of cell differentiation and development and other physiological processes. Many lncRNAs associate with chromatin-modifying complexes, are transcribed from enhancers and nucleate phase separation of nuclear condensates and domains, indicating an intimate link between lncRNA expression and the spatial control of gene expression during development. lncRNAs also have important roles in the cytoplasm and beyond, including in the regulation of translation, metabolism and signalling. lncRNAs often have a modular structure and are rich in repeats, which are increasingly being shown to be relevant to their function. In this Consensus Statement, we address the definition and nomenclature of lncRNAs and their conservation, expression, phenotypic visibility, structure and functions. We also discuss research challenges and provide recommendations to advance the understanding of the roles of lncRNAs in development, cell biology and disease.}

  abstract = {We sought to identify biomarkers which delineated individual hypertrophic responses to resistance training. Untrained, college-aged males engaged in  full-body resistance training (3 d/wk) for 12 weeks. Body composition via dual  x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), vastus lateralis (VL) thickness via ultrasound,  blood, VL muscle biopsies, and three-repetition maximum (3-RM) squat strength  were obtained prior to (PRE) and following (POST) 12 weeks of training. K-means  cluster analysis based on VL thickness changes identified LOW [n = 17; change  (mean±SD) = +0.11±0.14 cm], modest (MOD; n = 29, +0.40±0.06 cm), and high (HI; n  = 21, +0.69±0.14 cm) responders. Biomarkers related to histology, ribosome  biogenesis, proteolysis, inflammation, and androgen signaling were analyzed  between clusters. There were main effects of time (POST{$>$}PRE, p{$<$}0.05) but no  cluster×time interactions for increases in DXA lean body mass, type I and II  muscle fiber cross sectional area and myonuclear number, satellite cell number,  and macronutrients consumed. Interestingly, PRE VL thickness was \textasciitilde 12\% greater in  LOW versus HI (p = 0.021), despite POST values being \textasciitilde 12\% greater in HI versus  LOW (p = 0.006). However there was only a weak correlation between PRE VL  thickness scores and change in VL thickness (r2 = 0.114, p = 0.005). Forced post  hoc analysis indicated that muscle total RNA levels (i.e., ribosome density) did  not significantly increase in the LOW cluster (351±70 ng/mg to 380±62, p =  0.253), but increased in the MOD (369±115 to 429±92, p = 0.009) and HI clusters  (356±77 to 470±134, p{$<$}0.001; POST HI{$>$}POST LOW, p = 0.013). Nonetheless, there was  only a weak association between change in muscle total RNA and VL thickness (r2 =  0.079, p = 0.026). IL-1β mRNA levels decreased in the MOD and HI clusters  following training (p{$<$}0.05), although associations between this marker and VL  thickness changes were not significant (r2 = 0.0002, p = 0.919). In conclusion,  individuals with lower pre-training VL thickness values and greater increases  muscle total RNA levels following 12 weeks of resistance training experienced  greater VL muscle growth, although these biomarkers individually explained only  \textasciitilde 8-11\% of the variance in hypertrophy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are prone to accelerated decay of muscle strength and mass with advancing age. This is  believed to be driven by disease-inherent systemic pathophysiologies, which are  also assumed to drive muscle cells into a state of anabolic resistance, leading  to impaired abilities to adapt to resistance exercise training. Currently, this  phenomenon remains largely unstudied. In this study, we aimed to investigate the  assumed negative effects of COPD for health- and muscle-related responsiveness to  resistance training using a healthy control-based translational approach.  METHODS: Subjects with COPD (n\,=\,20, GOLD II-III, FEV(1predicted) 57\,±\,11\%, age  69\,±\,5) and healthy controls (Healthy, n\,=\,58, FEV(1predicted) 112\,±\,16\%, age  67\,±\,4) conducted identical whole-body resistance training interventions for  13~weeks, consisting of two weekly supervised training sessions. Leg exercises  were performed unilaterally, with one leg conducting high-load training (10RM)  and the contralateral leg conducting low-load training (30RM). Measurements  included muscle strength (n(variables)\,=\,7), endurance performance  (n(variables)\,=\,6), muscle mass (n(variables)\,=\,3), muscle quality, muscle  biology (m. vastus lateralis; muscle fiber characteristics, RNA content including  transcriptome) and health variables (body composition, blood). For core outcome  domains, weighted combined factors were calculated from the range of singular  assessments. RESULTS: COPD displayed well-known pathophysiologies at baseline,  including elevated levels of systemic low-grade inflammation ([c-reactive  protein](serum)), reduced muscle mass and functionality, and muscle biological  aberrancies. Despite this, resistance training led to improved lower-limb muscle  strength (15\,±\,8\%), muscle mass (7\,±\,5\%), muscle quality (8\,±\,8\%) and  lower-limb/whole-body endurance performance (26\,±\,12\%/8\,±\,9\%) in COPD, resembling  or exceeding responses in Healthy, measured in both relative and numeric change  terms. Within the COPD cluster, lower FEV(1predicted) was associated with larger  numeric and relative increases in muscle mass and superior relative improvements  in maximal muscle strength. This was accompanied by similar changes in hallmarks  of muscle biology such as rRNA-content↑, muscle fiber cross-sectional area↑, type  IIX proportions↓, and changes in mRNA transcriptomics. Neither of the core  outcome domains were differentially affected by resistance training load.  CONCLUSIONS: COPD showed hitherto largely unrecognized responsiveness to  resistance training, rejecting the notion of disease-related impairments and  rather advocating such training as a potent measure to relieve pathophysiologies.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lifestyle therapy with resistance training is a potent measure to counteract age-related loss in muscle strength and mass. Unfortunately, many  individuals fail to respond in the expected manner. This phenomenon is  particularly common among older adults and those with chronic diseases (e.g.  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD) and may involve endocrine variables  such as vitamin D. At present, the effects of vitamin D supplementation on  responses to resistance training remain largely unexplored. METHODS: Ninety-five  male and female participants (healthy, n~=~71; COPD, n~=~24; age 68~±~5~years)  were randomly assigned to receive either vitamin D(3) or placebo supplementation  for 28~weeks in a double-blinded manner (latitude 61°N, September-May).  Seventy-eight participants completed the RCT, which was initiated by 12~weeks of  supplementation-only (two weeks with 10~000~IU/day, followed by 2000~IU/day),  followed by 13~weeks of combined supplementation (2000~IU/day) and supervised  whole-body resistance training (twice weekly), interspersed with testing and  measurements. Outcome measures included multiple assessments of muscle strength  (n(variables) ~=~7), endurance performance (n~=~6), and muscle mass (n~=~3, legs,  primary), as well as muscle quality (legs), muscle biology (m. vastus lateralis;  muscle fibre characteristics, transcriptome), and health-related variables (e.g.  visceral fat mass and blood lipid profile). For main outcome domains such as  muscle strength and muscle mass, weighted combined factors were calculated from  the range of singular assessments. RESULTS: Overall, 13~weeks of resistance  training increased muscle strength (13\%~±~8\%), muscle mass (9\%~±~8\%), and  endurance performance (one-legged, 23\%~±~15\%; whole-body, 8\%~±~7\%), assessed as  weighted combined factors, and were associated with changes in health variables  (e.g. visceral fat, -6\%~±~21\%; [LDL](serum) , -4\%~±~14\%) and muscle tissue  characteristics such as fibre type proportions (e.g. IIX, -3\% points), myonuclei  per fibre (30\%~±~65\%), total RNA/rRNA abundances (15\%/6-19\%), and transcriptome  profiles (e.g. 312 differentially expressed genes).

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lifestyle therapy with resistance training is a potent measure to counteract age-related loss in muscle strength and mass. Unfortunately, many  individuals fail to respond in the expected manner. This phenomenon is  particularly common among older adults and those with chronic diseases (e.g.  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD) and may involve endocrine variables  such as vitamin D. At present, the effects of vitamin D supplementation on  responses to resistance training remain largely unexplored. METHODS: Ninety-five  male and female participants (healthy, n~=~71; COPD, n~=~24; age 68~±~5~years)  were randomly assigned to receive either vitamin D(3) or placebo supplementation  for 28~weeks in a double-blinded manner (latitude 61°N, September-May).  Seventy-eight participants completed the RCT, which was initiated by 12~weeks of  supplementation-only (two weeks with 10~000~IU/day, followed by 2000~IU/day),  followed by 13~weeks of combined supplementation (2000~IU/day) and supervised  whole-body resistance training (twice weekly), interspersed with testing and  measurements. Outcome measures included multiple assessments of muscle strength  (n(variables) ~=~7), endurance performance (n~=~6), and muscle mass (n~=~3, legs,  primary), as well as muscle quality (legs), muscle biology (m. vastus lateralis;  muscle fibre characteristics, transcriptome), and health-related variables (e.g.  visceral fat mass and blood lipid profile). For main outcome domains such as  muscle strength and muscle mass, weighted combined factors were calculated from  the range of singular assessments. RESULTS: Overall, 13~weeks of resistance  training increased muscle strength (13\%~±~8\%), muscle mass (9\%~±~8\%), and  endurance performance (one-legged, 23\%~±~15\%; whole-body, 8\%~±~7\%), assessed as  weighted combined factors, and were associated with changes in health variables  (e.g. visceral fat, -6\%~±~21\%; [LDL](serum) , -4\%~±~14\%) and muscle tissue  characteristics such as fibre type proportions (e.g. IIX, -3\% points), myonuclei  per fibre (30\%~±~65\%), total RNA/rRNA abundances (15\%/6-19\%), and transcriptome  profiles (e.g. 312 differentially expressed genes). Vitamin D(3) supplementation  did not affect training-associated changes for any of the main outcome domains,  despite robust increases in [25(OH)D](serum) (∆49\% vs. placebo). No conditional  effects were observed for COPD vs. healthy or pre-RCT [25(OH)D](serum) . In  secondary analyses, vitamin D(3) affected expression of gene sets involved in  vascular functions in muscle tissue and strength gains in participants with high  fat mass, which advocates further study.

  abstract = {Increasing muscle mass is important when attempting to maximize sports performance and achieve physique augmentation. However, the preservation of  muscle mass is essential to maintaining mobility and quality of life with aging,  and also impacts on our capacity to recover from illness. Nevertheless, our  understanding of the processes that regulate muscle mass in humans during  resistance exercise training, chronic disuse and rehabilitation training  following atrophy remains very unclear. Here, we report on some of the recent  developments in the study of those processes thought to be responsible for  governing human muscle protein turnover in response to intense physical activity.  Specifically, the effects of acute and chronic resistance exercise in healthy  volunteers and also in response to rehabilitation resistance exercise training  following muscle atrophy will be discussed, with discrepancies and gaps in our  understanding highlighted. In particular, ubiquitin-proteasome mediated muscle  proteolysis (Muscle Atrophy F-box/Atrogin-1 and Muscle RING Finger 1),  translation initiation of muscle protein synthesis (mammalian target of rapamycin  signaling), and satellite cell mediated myogenesis are highlighted as pathways of  special relevance to muscle protein metabolism in response to acute resistance  exercise. Furthermore, research focused on quantifying signaling and molecular  events that modulate muscle protein synthesis and protein degradation under  conditions of chronic resistance training is highlighted as being urgently needed  to improve knowledge gaps. These studies need to include multiple time-point  measurements over the course of any training intervention and must include  dynamic measurements of muscle protein synthesis and degradation and sensitive  measures of muscle mass. This article is part of a Directed Issue entitled  Molecular basis of muscle wasting.},

  abstract = {The objectives of this paper were to: (a) systematically review studies that explored the effects of exercise order (EO) on muscular strength and/or  hypertrophy; (b) pool their results using a meta-analysis; and (c) provide  recommendations for the prescription of EO in resistance training (RT)  programmes. A literature search was performed in four databases. Studies were  included if they explored the effects of EO on dynamic muscular strength and/or  muscle hypertrophy. The meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model  with Hedges' g effect size (ES). The methodological quality of studies was  appraised using the TESTEX checklist. Eleven good-to-excellent methodological  quality studies were included in the review. When all strength tests, that is,  both in multi-joint (MJ) and single-joint (SJ) exercises were considered, there  was no difference between the EOs (ES\,=\,-0.11; p\,=\,0.306). However, there was a  difference between the MJ-to-SJ and SJ-to-MJ orders for strength gains in the MJ  exercises, favouring starting the exercise session with MJ exercises (ES\,=\,0.32;  p\,=\,0.034), and the strength gains in the SJ exercises, favouring starting the  exercise session with SJ exercises (ES\,=\,-0.58; p\,=\,0.032). No significant effect  of EO was observed for hypertrophy combining site-specific and indirect measures  (ES\,=\,0.03; p\,=\,0.862). In conclusion, increases in muscular strength are the  largest in the exercises performed at the beginning of an exercise session. For  muscle hypertrophy, our meta-analysis indicated that both MJ-to-SJ and SJ-to-MJ  EOs may produce similar results.},

  abstract = {Long non-coding RNAs were once considered as “junk” RNA produced by aberrant DNA transcription. They are now understood to play central roles in diverse cellular processes from proliferation and migration to differentiation, senescence and DNA damage control. LncRNAs are classed as transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides that do not encode a peptide. They are relevant to many physiological and pathophysiological processes through their control of fundamental molecular functions. This review summarises the recent progress in lncRNA research and highlights the far-reaching physiological relevance of lncRNAs. The main areas of lncRNA research encompassing their characterisation, classification and mechanisms of action will be discussed. In particular, the regulation of gene expression and chromatin landscape through lncRNA control of proteins, DNA and other RNAs will be introduced. This will be exemplified with a selected number of lncRNAs that have been described in numerous physiological contexts and that should be largely representative of the tens-of-thousands of mammalian lncRNAs. To some extent, these lncRNAs have inspired the current thinking on the central dogmas of epigenetics, RNA and DNA mechanisms.}

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of intradialytic exercise (IDE) (exercise performed during dialysis) on sarcopenia and quality of life (QoL) in patients  with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). DATA SOURCES: A comprehensive search of 7  electronic databases was performed to identify randomized controlled trials  measuring the effects of IDE in adults with ESRD. Searches were limited to the  English language. STUDY SELECTION: Included studies were randomized controlled  trials that measured the effects of IDE in adults with ESRD. Comparator groups  received usual care or low-intensity sham interventions. Outcomes of interest  were muscle mass, strength, physical function, and QoL. Papers were independently  screened for eligibility by 2 authors, and any discrepancies resolved by a third  author. DATA EXTRACTION: One author extracted the data from the included studies.  Data were compared and discussed across the team members. Two authors  independently assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool.  Quality was assessed using the van Tulder scale and a narrative synthesis was  conducted. Best evidence synthesis was used to structure the reviews findings.  DATA SYNTHESIS: Fourteen studies were included in this review (n=837). While risk  of bias was found high in 11 studies, demonstrating mainly selection,  performance, and detection bias, the best evidence synthesis indicated strong  evidence of resistance training improving muscle mass (16\%-4.2\%) and strength  (45\%-18\%), and moderate evidence of combined exercise improving strength (37\%),  and various physical function scores. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, there is strong  evidence of resistance exercise, with moderate evidence of combined exercise,  improving sarcopenia-related muscle and strength loss, and QoL in end-stage  kidney disease. Adequately powered, good quality studies are required to  determine the optimal exercise prescription to maximize outcomes.},

Aim1 was to determine the agreement between midthigh vastus lateralis (VL) cross-sectional area measured by ultrasound (mCSA(US))  versus magnetic resonance imaging (mCSA(MRI)) at a single time point, and the  ability of each to detect hypertrophic changes. Aim2 was to assess the  relationships between pre- and posttraining changes in thigh lean mass determined  by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), VL mCSA(US), ultrasound-determined VL  thickness (VL(Thick)), and VL mean myofiber cross-sectional area (fCSA) with  changes in VL mCSA(MRI). Twelve untrained males (age: 20\,±\,1 yr, BMI: 26.9\,±\,5.4  kg/m(2); n = 12) engaged in a 10-wk resistance training program (2×/week) where  right midthigh images and VL biopsies were obtained before and 72 h following the  last training bout. Participants' VL mCSA(MRI) (P = 0.005), DXA thigh lean mass  (P = 0.015), and VL(Thick) (P = 0.001) increased following training, whereas VL  mCSA(US) and fCSA did not. For Aim1, mCSA(US) demonstrated excellent concordance  [concordance correlation coefficients (CCC) = 0.830] with mCSA(MRI), albeit  mCSA(US) values were systematically lower compared with mCSA(MRI) (mean bias:  -2.29 cm(2)). In addition, PRE-to-POST VL mCSA changes between techniques  exhibited good agreement (CCC = 0.700; mean bias: -1.08 cm(2)). For Aim2,  moderate, positive correlations existed for pre-to-post changes in VL mCSA(MRI)  and DXA thigh lean mass (r = 0.580, P = 0.048), mCSA(US) (r = 0.622, P = 0.031),  and VL(Thick) (r = 0.520, P = 0.080). A moderate, negative correlation existed  between mCSA(MRI) and fCSA (r = -0.569, P = 0.054). Our findings have multiple  implications: 1) resistance training-induced hypertrophy was dependent on the  quantification method, 2) ultrasound-determined mCSA shows good agreement with  MRI, and 3) tissue-level changes poorly agreed with mean fCSA changes and this  requires further research.NEW \& NOTEWORTHY This is the first study to  comprehensively examine how different midthigh muscle imaging techniques and  histology compare with one another in participants that performed 10 weeks of  resistance training. Our study suggests that histology results show poor  agreement with results yielded from other common muscle imaging techniques, and  researchers should be aware of this limitation.},

DMSe has been recently revealed as a precursor of secondary organic aerosol  (SOA), and its resultant SOA possesses strong oxidizing capability toward thiol  groups that can perturb several major biological pathways in human airway  epithelial cells and is linked to genotoxicity, DNA damage, and p53-mediated  stress responses. Mounting evidence has suggested that long noncoding RNAs  (lncRNAs) are involved in stress responses to internal and environmental stimuli.  However, the underlying molecular interactions remain to be elucidated. In this  study, we performed integrative analyses of lncRNA-mRNA coexpression in the  transformed human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cell line exposed to DMSe-derived  SOA. We identified a total of 971 differentially expressed lncRNAs in BEAS-2B  cells exposed to SOA derived from O(3) and OH oxidation of DMSe. Gene ontology  (GO) network analysis of cis-targeted genes showed significant enrichment of DNA  damage, apoptosis, and p53-mediated stress response pathways. trans-Acting  lncRNAs, including PINCR, PICART1, DLGAP1-AS2, and LINC01629, known to be  associated with human carcinogenesis, also showed altered expression in cell  treated with DMSe-SOA. Overall, this study highlights the regulatory role of  lncRNAs in altered gene expression induced by DMSe-SOA exposure.},

  abstract = {Ageing is the single greatest cause of disease and death worldwide, and understanding the associated processes could vastly improve quality of life. Although major categories of ageing damage have been identified—such as altered intercellular communication, loss of proteostasis and eroded mitochondrial function1—these deleterious processes interact with extraordinary complexity within and between organs, and a comprehensive, whole-organism analysis of ageing dynamics has been lacking. Here we performed bulk RNA sequencing of 17 organs and plasma proteomics at 10 ages across the lifespan of Mus musculus, and integrated these findings with data from the accompanying Tabula Muris Senis2—or ‘Mouse Ageing Cell Atlas’—which follows on from the original Tabula Muris3. We reveal linear and nonlinear shifts in gene expression during ageing, with the associated genes clustered in consistent trajectory groups with coherent biological functions—including extracellular matrix regulation, unfolded protein binding, mitochondrial function, and inflammatory and immune response. Notably, these gene sets show similar expression across tissues, differing only in the amplitude and the age of onset of expression. Widespread activation of immune cells is especially pronounced, and is first detectable in white adipose depots during middle age. Single-cell RNA sequencing confirms the accumulation of T cells and B cells in adipose tissue—including plasma cells that express immunoglobulin J—which also accrue concurrently across diverse organs. Finally, we show how gene expression shifts in distinct tissues are highly correlated with corresponding protein levels in plasma, thus potentially contributing to the ageing of the systemic circulation. Together, these data demonstrate a similar yet asynchronous inter- and intra-organ progression of ageing, providing a foundation from which to track systemic sources of declining health at old age.}

Trained college-aged males (n = 11, 23 ± 4 years old, 4 ± 3 years  self-reported training) performed LL or HL bouts to failure separated by one  week. The HL bout (i.e., 80 Fail) consisted of four sets of back squats and four  sets of leg extensions to failure using 80\% of participants estimated  one-repetition maximum (i.e., est. 1-RM). The LL bout (i.e., 30 Fail) implemented  the same paradigm with 30\% of est. 1-RM. Vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were  collected before, 3 h, and 6 h after each bout. Muscle DNA and RNA were  batch-isolated and analyzed using the 850k Illumina MethylationEPIC array and  Clariom S mRNA microarray, respectively. Performed repetitions were significantly  greater during the 30 Fail versus 80 Fail (p {$<$} 0.001), although total training  volume (sets × reps × load) was not significantly different between bouts (p =  0.571). Regardless of bout, more CpG site methylation changes were observed at 3  h versus 6 h post exercise (239,951 versus 12,419, respectively; p {$<$} 0.01), and  nuclear global ten-eleven translocation (TET) activity, but not global DNA  methyltransferase activity, increased 3 h and 6 h following exercise regardless  of bout. The percentage of genes significantly altered at the mRNA level that  demonstrated opposite DNA methylation patterns was greater 3 h versus 6 h  following exercise (\textasciitilde 75\% versus \textasciitilde 15\%, respectively). Moreover, high percentages  of genes that were up- or downregulated 6 h following exercise also demonstrated  significantly inversed DNA methylation patterns across one or more CpG sites 3 h  following exercise (65\% and 82\%, respectively). While 30 Fail decreased DNA  methylation across various promoter regions versus 80 Fail, transcriptome-wide  mRNA and bioinformatics indicated that gene expression signatures were largely  similar between bouts. Bioinformatics overlay of DNA methylation and mRNA  expression data indicated that genes related to "Focal adhesion," "MAPK  signaling," and "PI3K-Akt signaling" were significantly affected at the 3 h and 6  h time points, and again this was regardless of bout. In conclusion, extensive  molecular profiling suggests that post-exercise alterations in the skeletal  muscle DNA methylome and mRNA transcriptome elicited by LL and HL training bouts  to failure are largely similar, and this could be related to equal volumes  performed between bouts.},

How an effective stoichiometry of this many  constituent subunits is co-ordinated post-transcriptionally remains poorly  understood. Here we show that Cerox1, an unusually abundant cytoplasmic long  noncoding RNA (lncRNA), modulates the levels of mitochondrial complex I subunit  transcripts in a manner that requires binding to microRNA-488-3p. Increased  abundance of Cerox1 cooperatively elevates complex I subunit protein abundance  and enzymatic activity, decreases reactive oxygen species production, and  protects against the complex I inhibitor rotenone. Cerox1 function is conserved  across placental mammals: human and mouse orthologues effectively modulate  complex I enzymatic activity in mouse and human cells, respectively. Cerox1 is  the first lncRNA demonstrated, to our knowledge, to regulate mitochondrial  oxidative phosphorylation and, with miR-488-3p, represent novel targets for the  modulation of complex I activity.},

Our strategy detects ∼3-4 times more regulated genes than similarly sized  studies, including substantial UTR-selective regulation undetected by other  methods. We discover a core of 141 genes correlated to muscle growth, which we  validate from newly analyzed independent samples (n~= 100). Further validating  these identified genes via RNAi in primary muscle cells, we demonstrate that  members of the core genes were regulators of protein synthesis. Using  proteome-constrained networks and pathway analysis reveals notable relationships  with the molecular characteristics of human muscle aging and insulin sensitivity,  as well as potential drug therapies.},

The results users obtain from GeneFriends include a  co-expression network as well as a summary of the functional enrichment among the  co-expressed genes. Novel insights can be gathered from this database for  different splice variants and ncRNAs, such as microRNAs and lincRNAs.  Furthermore, our updated tool allows candidate transcripts to be linked to  diseases and processes using a guilt-by-association approach.

  abstract = {Considerable inter-individual heterogeneity exists in the muscular adaptations to resistance training. It has been proposed that fast-twitch fibers are more  sensitive to hypertrophic stimuli and thus that variation in muscle fiber type  composition is a contributing factor to the magnitude of training response. This  study investigated if the inter-individual variability in resistance training  adaptations is determined by muscle typology and if the most appropriate weekly  training frequency depends on muscle typology. In strength-training novices, 11  slow (ST) and 10 fast typology (FT) individuals were selected by measuring muscle  carnosine with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Participants trained both  upper arm and leg muscles to failure at 60\% 1RM for 10 weeks, whereby one arm and  leg trained 3x/week, the contralateral arm and leg 2x/week. Muscle volume  (MRI-based 3D segmentation), maximal dynamic strength (one-repetition maximum,  1RM) and fiber-type specific cross-sectional area (vastus lateralis biopsies)  were evaluated. The training response for total muscle volume (+3 to +14\%), fiber  size (-19 to +22\%) and strength (+17 to +47\%) showed considerable  inter-individual variability, but these could not be attributed to differences in  muscle typology. However, ST individuals performed a significantly higher  training volume to gain these similar adaptations as FT individuals. The limb  that trained 3x/week had generally more pronounced hypertrophy than the limb that  trained 2x/week, and there was no interaction with muscle typology. In  conclusion, muscle typology cannot explain the high variability in resistance  training adaptations when training is performed to failure at 60\% of 1RM. KEY  POINTS: This study investigated the influence of muscle typology ( = muscle fiber  type composition) on the variability in resistance training adaptations and on  its role in the individualization of resistance training frequency. We  demonstrate that an individual's muscle typology cannot explain the  inter-individual variability in resistance training induced increases in muscle  volume, maximal dynamic strength and fiber cross-sectional area when repetitions  are performed to failure. Importantly, slow typology individuals performed a  significantly higher training volume to obtain similar adaptations compared to  fast typology individuals. Muscle typology does not determine the most  appropriate resistance training frequency. However, regardless of muscle  typology, an additional weekly training (3x/week vs 2x/week) increases muscle  hypertrophy but not maximal dynamic strength. These findings expand on our  understanding of the underlying mechanisms for the large inter-individual  variability in resistance training adaptations. Abstract figure legend This study  investigated if muscle typology can explain the high variability in resistance  training adaptations. Slow and fast typology resistance training novices were  selected to participate in this study by the non-invasive measurement of muscle  carnosine with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. After the chronic training  period a high inter-individual variability was observed in changes in muscle  volume, maximal dynamic strength and fiber cross-sectional area. However, this  high inter-individual variability could not be explained by muscle typology for  any of the outcomes. Visual abstract created with BioRender. This article is  protected by copyright.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Obesity causes frailty in older adults; however, weight loss might accelerate age-related loss of muscle and bone mass and resultant sarcopenia and  osteopenia. METHODS: In this clinical trial involving 160 obese older adults, we  evaluated the effectiveness of several exercise modes in reversing frailty and  preventing reduction in muscle and bone mass induced by weight loss. Participants  were randomly assigned to a weight-management program plus one of three exercise  programs - aerobic training, resistance training, or combined aerobic and  resistance training - or to a control group (no weight-management or exercise  program). The primary outcome was the change in Physical Performance Test score  from baseline to 6 months (scores range from 0 to 36 points; higher scores  indicate better performance). Secondary outcomes included changes in other  frailty measures, body composition, bone mineral density, and physical functions.  RESULTS: A total of 141 participants completed the study. The Physical  Performance Test score increased more in the combination group than in the  aerobic and resistance groups (27.9 to 33.4 points [21\% increase] vs. 29.3 to  33.2 points [14\% increase] and 28.8 to 32.7 points [14\% increase], respectively;  P=0.01 and P=0.02 after Bonferroni correction); the scores increased more in all  exercise groups than in the control group (P{$<$}0.001 for between-group  comparisons). Peak oxygen consumption (milliliters per kilogram of body weight  per minute) increased more in the combination and aerobic groups (17.2 to 20.3  [17\% increase] and 17.6 to 20.9 [18\% increase], respectively) than in the  resistance group (17.0 to 18.3 [8\% increase]) (P{$<$}0.001 for both comparisons).  Strength increased more in the combination and resistance groups (272 to 320 kg  [18\% increase] and 288 to 337 kg [19\% increase], respectively) than in the  aerobic group (265 to 270 kg [4\% increase]) (P{$<$}0.001 for both comparisons). Body  weight decreased by 9\% in all exercise groups but did not change significantly in  the control group. Lean mass decreased less in the combination and resistance  groups than in the aerobic group (56.5 to 54.8 kg [3\% decrease] and 58.1 to 57.1  kg [2\% decrease], respectively, vs. 55.0 to 52.3 kg [5\% decrease]), as did bone  mineral density at the total hip (grams per square centimeter; 1.010 to 0.996 [1\%  decrease] and 1.047 to 1.041 [0.5\% decrease], respectively, vs. 1.018 to 0.991  [3\% decrease]) (P{$<$}0.05 for all comparisons). Exercise-related adverse events  included musculoskeletal injuries. CONCLUSIONS: Of the methods tested, weight  loss plus combined aerobic and resistance exercise was the most effective in  improving functional status of obese older adults.

To investigate the effect of resistance exercise  versus aerobic exercise on blood glucose level, insulin utilization rate, and  pregnancy outcome in patients with GDM. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: From  December 2019 to December 2020, 100 pregnant women with GDM were selected and  divided into a resistance exercise group (49 patients) and an aerobic exercise  group (51 patients) randomly. The aerobic exercise group received an aerobic  exercise intervention, while the resistance exercise group received a resistance  exercise intervention. Both groups received exercise intervention for 50-60\,min,  3 times per week, lasting for 6 weeks. In addition, patients in both groups  received the same routine care, including personalized dietary intervention,  online education, and school courses for pregnant women. RESULTS: The blood  glucose level in the resistance exercise group and the aerobic exercise group was  lower after the intervention than before the intervention (p{$<$}0.05). After the  intervention, no significant differences were observed in the fasting blood  glucose level, insulin utilization rate, and incidence of adverse pregnancy  outcomes between the two groups (p{$>$}0.05); however, significant differences were  noted in 2-hour postprandial blood glucose level and exercise compliance between  the two groups (p{$<$}0.05), with the resistance exercise group showing better  outcomes than the aerobic exercise group. CONCLUSIONS: Resistance exercise is  more compliant for pregnant women with GDM than aerobic exercise; hence, it is  necessary to popularize resistance exercise in this specific population group.  Long-term effects of resistance exercise should be evaluated in future studies.  TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ChiCTR 1900027929.},

  abstract = {The long non-coding RNAs associating with other molecules can coordinate several physiological processes and their dysfunction can impact diverse human diseases. To date, systematic and intensive annotations on diverse interaction regulations of lncRNAs in human cancer were not available. Here, we built lncRNAfunc, a knowledgebase of lncRNA function in human cancer at https://ccsm.uth.edu/lncRNAfunc, aiming to provide a resource and reference for providing therapeutically targetable lncRNAs and intensive interaction regulations. To do this, we collected 15 900 lncRNAs across 33 cancer types from TCGA. For individual lncRNAs, we performed multiple interaction analyses of different biomolecules including DNA, RNA, and protein levels. Our intensive studies of lncRNAs provide diverse potential mechanisms of lncRNAs that regulate gene expression through binding enhancers and 3′-UTRs of genes, competing for miRNA binding sites with mRNAs, recruiting the transcription factors to gene promoters. Furthermore, we investigated lncRNAs that potentially affect the alternative splicing events through interacting with RNA binding Proteins. We also performed multiple functional annotations including cancer stage-associated lncRNAs, RNA A-to-I editing event-associated lncRNAs, and lncRNA expression quantitative trait loci. lncRNAfunc is a unique resource for cancer research communities to help better understand potential lncRNA regulations and therapeutic lncRNA targets.}
